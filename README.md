# Digital-IC-Design-Diploma-System-Project

o	Low Power Configurable Multi Clock Digital System‚Äù

o	Receiving command through UART RX 

o	Register file reading /writing or doing processing using ALU block then send results using UART_TX

o	FIFO to handle different clock rates and avoid data loss 

o	Integrate and verify functionality through self-checking testbench.

o	Constraining the system using synthesis TCL scripts.

o	Synthesize and optimize the design using design compiler tool.

o	Analyze Timing paths and fix setup and hold violations

o	Physical implementation of the system passing through ASIC flow phases and generate the GDS File.

o	Verify functionality post-layout considering the actual delays.
